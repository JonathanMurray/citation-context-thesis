# Improved citation context detection methods
### A master thesis project in Natural Langage Processing and Machine Learning. 
---
## 1. Intro
This repository contains the code used in my master thesis about citation context detection. To get an understanding of the area and the specific task of this project, one should read the thesis. Simply put the task is: "given a research paper and one of its references, find all sentences in the paper that implicitly cites this reference." 

* **explicit citation**: A citation to another paper found in running text, that uses some well-defined format.
* **implicit citation**: A citation that does not use such a format.

The text snippet below consists of three sentences, one that is not a citation, one explicit citation, and one implicit.

*The purpose of this project is to develop efficient sorting algorithms. Johnson et. al (1987) proposed the bubble sort algorithm. It proved a failure.*
